== Running the Specs/Tests for FixtureReplacement

You will need rspec (version 1.0.8 or later) to run the specs, as well as the sqlite3-ruby gem
(and sqlite3 installed):

  % gem install rspec sqlite3-ruby

cd into the fixture_replacement plugin directory:

  % cd vendor/plugins/fixture_replacement

Then run with <tt>rake</tt>

  % rake

There are also some tests for test/unit.  These mainly serve as regressions, but you are free
to run them as well.
