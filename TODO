TODO:
- Refactor - Never Done? - This is particularly hard now.  
   
  Scope is a big concern.  How would I refactor mod.module_eval { define_method { }} bits?  Instance_eval would work,
  but then we need to deal with block params, and the value of self.  
  
  Another problem: How would I refactor out what comes inside of the define_method, short of adding private methods
  to the module in question? 

- Error checking.  Hashes should always be returned from the valid_* methods
- Remove Duplication, make DRY!
